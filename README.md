# Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-World-Bank-Military-Spending
A Python project I completed in 2025.
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of global defense economics, focusing on the top 10 military spenders from 2018-2022. Utilizing Python for data cleaning and processing, the program evaluates military expenditures through various lenses, including absolute spending, percentage of GDP, and per capita comparisons. The analysis identifies the fastest-growing nations in defense spending while visualizing key trends through generated data frames and plots. Beyond the data, the project documents the technical workflow and the learning process involved in building a well-documented, reproducible codebase.
